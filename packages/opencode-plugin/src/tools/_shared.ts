/**
 * Shared helpers for plugin tool handlers.
 *
 * Every tool that talks to the Rust binary should use `callBridge()` instead
 * of calling `ctx.pool.getBridge(...).send(...)` directly. The helper:
 *
 *   1. Resolves the project root from `context.worktree ?? context.directory`
 *      (canonical path), so two tool calls in the same project always reach
 *      the same bridge even if the agent's cwd momentarily differs.
 *   2. Injects `session_id` from `context.sessionID` into every request so the
 *      Rust side can partition undo/checkpoint state per OpenCode session
 *      (issue #14 — one shared bridge per project, N sessions per bridge).
 *
 * Tools that specifically need the raw `BinaryBridge` (for example to call
 * `bridge.send()` multiple times with shared state) should use `bridgeFor()`
 * and still pass `session_id` explicitly.
